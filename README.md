# Cinder-CppRESTSDK
Allows you to easily add Microsoft's CppRESTSDK to your project.

## Important!
Cinder requires statically linked libraries in order for this to work. The files are part of this repository, but due to their massive size they are stored using Git Large File Storage (see https://git-lfs.github.com/). Make sure to install the LFS extension. You can find instructions in the provided link.

After cloning or checking out the repository, perform the following command from a terminal or command line:

```git lfs pull```

If the LFS extension was installed correctly, it will download the large library files.

##Static libraries
In case you want to update the libraries and build them yourself, see:
